# Pet Food Tracker

This is a simple app built with Jetpack Compose in Android Studio. It's meant to be a simple tracker to see if you remembered to feed your pet both in the morning and afternoon of any given day.

## Setup Instructions

 - download & open android studio
 - paste the link to this repo into the "Repository URL" field of the "clone repository" option for starting a project with the git version control setting
 - wait for it to load all the dependencies and then you will need to configure an android emulator (or plug in an android phone with debug permissions) and then hit the run button.
